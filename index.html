<p id='btitext'>The Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP) under SARC will host the second "Break the Ice" session during Alumination. The event aims to build the mentor-mentee rapport by sharing a hearty lunch together and answering the doubts mentees gained as they progressed through their tumultuous years at the institute. BTI provides an unrestrained platform for mentees to share all their concerns and enables them to get a fresh perspective on their life choices, with a much-needed insight from their mentorsâ€™ advice.
